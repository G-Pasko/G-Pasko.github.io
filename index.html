          &emsp;My name is Granger Pasko! I'm a computer scientist, video game developer, volleyball player, and a passionate environmentalist. I first knew I wanted to become a programmer when I was a kid. I loved video games and always wondered how they worked and had a deep desire to create my own video games one day. One day, I looked up how to code in Java and was so intimidated, that it took me 7 years to give coding another shot. I tried my hand at the AP Computer Science class but found myself struggling to keep up with the class. I had thought that my coding career and ended there and that I just wasn't built for it. When I was waiting for my college acceptance letters, I was shocked to see that I had been accepted into UCSC's Computer Science program, the only computer science program I had even applied for at any college. It took me a while to make my final decision, but I decided to give computer science at Santa Cruz a shot and fell in love with coding and the town. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the Baskin School of Engineering, and receiving an honors distinction in my department, I moved back to my hometown of San Diego to begin my professional journey.
