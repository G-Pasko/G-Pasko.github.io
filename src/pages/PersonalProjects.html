            &emsp; Color runner is a 2D endless runner  where you have to switch the colors of the game in order to see some of the obsticles that come your way. As you can see in the screen shots, some obsticles are white and some are black, so all obsticles have a 50% chance of not being visable at any given time. Slowly, the game will speed up as you survive. All assets and code in this game was written by me (except a controller script inspired by Brackey's on YouTube). Think you have what it takes?

            &emsp; Solar Clicker is an “idle game” with the goal of clicking your sappling to collect sunlight. You use that sunlight to buy upgrades and increase your rate of collection both actively and passively. You can upgrade your tree to eventually be a full grown oak, unlocking upgrades like the bee hive or mushrooms to really boost your solar collection and even an upgrade to gain points while the app is closed. I developed all the code, assets, music, etc. This was also the my first game I ever created.

            &emsp; Green City Manager is a strategy game with the goal of educating the youth about climate positive city planning and the effects humans have on greenhouse gases. Manage the city by enacting policies and building projects. Balance the happiness of the citizens and businesses. Raise the environmental and political awareness of the city’s citizens. Turn the city carbon neutral within 50 turns to win! Think you have what it takes? Try Green City Mangaer <a href="https://apileofbacon.itch.io/green-city-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>. I spooled and manipulated those data using a system of equations applied to various variables across different classes.

            &emsp; Immersive 3D rogue-like where you explore the ocean as a sea turtle. Study the ocean and pollution by collecting research tokens. Spend research tokens on upgrades and resources to clean the ocean. Complete your research to reach your end destination and win. For this, I spooled in data such as player location and timers, and programmed the various classes of obstacles and their interactions with the player.
