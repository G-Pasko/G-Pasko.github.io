            &emsp; Color runner is a 2D endless runner  where you have to switch the colors of the game in order to see some of the obsticles that come your way. As you can see in the screen shots, some obsticles are white and some are black, so all obsticles have a 50% chance of not being visable at any given time. Slowly, the game will speed up as you survive. All assets and code in this game was written by me (except a controller script inspired by Brackey's on YouTube).

            &emsp; Solar Clicker is an “idle game” with the goal of clicking your sappling to collect sunlight. You use that sunlight to buy upgrades and increase your rate of collection both actively and passively. You can upgrade your tree to eventually be a full grown oak, unlocking upgrades like the bee hive or mushrooms to really boost your solar collection and even an upgrade to gain points while the app is closed. I developed all the code, assets, music, etc. This was also the my first game I ever created.
