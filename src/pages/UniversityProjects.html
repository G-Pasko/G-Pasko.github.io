            &emsp;Using a simulated version of Pacman, we used Python to simulate a Pacman agent to play the game as well as possible. We wrote these agents using react methods, Q-Learning agents, and Minimax. At the end of the year, we also wrote a 2-agent script that competed in a class-wide capture the flag tournament.

            &emsp;An n-gram model gets trained on various text files and analyzes the sequences of up to n words. After training, the program can take inputs and predict the following word or tell you the probability of an entered phrase based on the training data.

            &emsp;K-means, an unsupervised learning algorithm aimed at grouping and discriminating data, was another algorithm we wrote in one of my machine learning classes. The goal was to group sets of data into K clusters by using various methods of analysis like coordinates or other fields in the data provided. We iterate over all of our clusters and measure the variance of our points per cluster. Each time we make that iteration, we update our K clusters to find the best fit.

          <strong class="section-body">
            &emsp;Using feed from a camera, the program queues up frames from the footage to be processed by the program. The program iterates over every pixel of the first frame to get its hexadecimal color value. Then, it compares those values to that of the next frame and replaces its stored values with the new ones if they are different, while simultaneously increasing a counter for the number of different pixels. If the number of different pixels between frames reaches a specified threshold, it will return a "Movement detected" message to the user.

          <strong class="section-body">
            &emsp;I started by creating a .txt file that had all 5 letter words in the English language separated by new lines. I then wrote a program that, when started, would pick a word from that file at random and then prompt the user to enter a 5-letter word. After the input is entered, the program loops through the input to return a 5-letter string with each index representing the corresponding letter's accuracy. G being "correct letter, correct placement", Y being "correct letter, wrong placement" and R being "Letter not in mystery word".

            &emsp; I also created a separate program that uses the same word bank as the previous program but instead had the goal of SOLVING Wordle. The program starts by rating all of the words by their letters of appearance in the word bank. In every round, the program will return the highest scoring word, always starting with "irate", and the user will then enter that result into Wordle. The user enters Wordle's response back to the program (Solver). The Solver then edits the available word bank to filter out impossible options and returns the next highest-scoring word that follows the conditions provided by Wordle's assessment of the previous guesses.

          <strong class="section-body">
            &emsp;This program was a system of threads that broke the input file(s) into tokens. In parallel, these threads would parse the document and use mutexes (single access function locks) to increase the count of each word used. The use of threads and mutexes made it a very fast document reader.

              &emsp; Looking For Slugs was a passion project created by me and my friends for our Software Engineering class aimed to promote student social outreach by providing a hub for social gatherings and clubs. Students could log in and post their events around campus or search/RSVP for events posted by other users. For security, we added a protection for the sign-up that only @ucsc.edu domain emails can bypass. I was in charge of writing our backend that stored the events, automatically cleaning the database, the search engine, and more. Below is a video demo of our app.
