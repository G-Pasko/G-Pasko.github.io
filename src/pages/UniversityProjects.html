            <strong class="section-body">
            &emsp;Using a simulated version of Pacman, we used python to simulate a Pacman agent to play the game as well as possible. We wrote these agents using react methods, Q-Learning agents, and Minimax. At the end of the year, we also wrote a 2-agent script that competed in a class-wide capture the flag tournament.

            <strong class="section-body">
            &emsp;An n-gram model gets trained on various text files and analyze the sequences of up to n words. After training, the program can take inputs and predict the following word or tell you the probability of an entered phrase based on the training data.

            <strong class="section-body">
            &emsp;K-means, an unsupervised learning algorithm aimed at grouping and discriminating data, was another algorithm we wrote in one of my machine learning classes. The goal was to group sets of data into K clusters by using various methods of analysis like coordinates or other fields in the data provided. We iterate over all of our clusters and measure the variance of our points per cluster. Each time we make that iteration, we update our K clusters to find the best fit.

            &emsp;I started by creating a .txt file that had all 5 letter words in the english language seporated by new lines. I then wrote a program that, when started, would pick a word from that file at random then promt the user to enter a 5 letter word. After  the input is entered, the program loops through the input to return a 5 letter string with each index representing the correspodning leter's accuracy. G being "correct letter, correct placement", Y being "correct letter, wrong placement" and R being "Letter not in mystery word".

            &emsp;I also created a seporate program that used the same word bank as the previous program, but instead had the goal of solving wordles. The program starts by rating all of the words by their letters' of appearance in the word bank. Every round, the program will return the highest scoring word, always starting with "irate", and the user will return it's accuracy using the same G,Y,R system as described above. It then edits the programs viewable word bank to filter our impossible options, and then returns the next highest scroing word that follows the conditions provided by the users assessment of the previous guesses.

          <div class="section-subtitle">KVS Cache</div>
          <strong class="section-body">
            &emsp;This program was a system of threads that broke the input file(s) into tokens. In parallel, these threads would parse the document and use mutexes (sigle access function locks) to increase the count of each word used. The use of threads and mutexes made it a very fast document reader.

            &emsp;I created a large variety of classes from higher levels of abstraction like lists, linked lists, dictionaries, and graphs from scratch. I also wrote various classical search algorithms like DFS, BFS, binary search, and more!
